# What's Good?!

Welcome to my little slice of Github. There's a couple pinned repos of things I find interesting/experimenting with, especially distributed computing stuff (like Akka). Also a good amount of Typescript projects (both frontend, backend via various runtimes) to check out.

Languages I like, in order of proficiency:
- Typescript/JS
- Scala
- Java
- C#
- C
- Zig

Lanuages I'm on the fence about. Interesting languge features but don't really take me:
- Rust
- Go
- Elixir

Languages I've tried but don't really care for:
- Python
- Ruby
- Scheme

Books that have made step changes in my carrer and highly recommend:
- [Scala for the Impatient](https://www.informit.com/store/scala-for-the-impatient-9780138033651?ranMID=24808)
- [Kubernetes In Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action)
- [Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++: Event-Driven Programming for Embedded Systems](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0750687061?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title)
