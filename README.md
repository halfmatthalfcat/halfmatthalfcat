# What's Good?!

Welcome to my little slice of Github. There's a couple pinned repos of things I find interesting/experimenting with, especially distributed computing stuff (like Akka). Also a good amount of Typescript projects (both frontend, backend via various runtimes) to check out.

Head over to [my personal site](https://halfmatthalfcat.com) for a more bloggy experience.
