# What's Good?!

Welcome to my little slice of Github. There's a couple pinned repos of things I find interesting/experimenting with, especially distributed computing stuff (like Akka). Also a good amount of Typescript projects (both frontend, backend via various runtimes) to check out.

Languages I like, in order of proficiency:
- Typescript/JS
- Scala
- Java
- C#
- Rust
- Go
- Python
